## About
The IvI P(h)D council was established in early 2020 as an initiative proposed by the P(h)D community of IvI. Our task is to care for the interest of PhD candidates and postocs of the [Informatics Institute](https://ivi.uva.nl) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl).

The mission of the IvI P(h)D council is twofold: (1) create a sense of community among IvI PhDs and postdocs, and (2) provide a voice and a platform for them to address issues and relevant topics.

## Join us
The IvI P(h)D Council has recently been started, and we are recruiting. We seek to improve the experience of PhDs and postdocs during their time at IvI in a broad variety of ways. These include:
- Planning fun activities to bring the P(h)D community together, so that you can know your colleagues and their works better.
- General support on any issues P(h)Ds are faced with.
